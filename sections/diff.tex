\item Comparing files on the same branch
\comm{git diff} (shows the difference between working and staging area for all files\rightarrow to be staged, i.e., git add)
\comm{git diff SOME\_FILE} (shows the difference between working and staging area for a given file)
\comm{git \dhyphen staged diff} (shows the difference between staging area and last commit for all files\rightarrow to be commited)
\comm{git \dhyphen cached diff} (the same as above)
\comm{git diff HEAD} (combines "git diff" and "git diff \dhyphenr staged")
\item Comparing files between two branches
  \comm{git branch BRANCH\_A..BRANCH\_B} (compares all files)
  \comm{git branch BRANCH\_A..BRANCH\_B SOME\_FILE} (compares only a given files)
